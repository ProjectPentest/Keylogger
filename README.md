# Keylogger-Detection

## Objective

The Keylogger-Detection project is aimed to enhance the understanding of keyloggers, their functionality and behavior in order to build effective mechanisms for detection and prevention. By first developing a keylogger, the project aims to gain insights into how these tools operate, including how they capture keystroke data, manage buffers, and interact with system resources. This hands-on approach should provide intake on identifying signature traits and patterns which make keyloggers detectable.
In the second stage the project focuses on constructing robust defense systems capable of recognizing keylogger activity. This project contributes to the broader goal of protecting sensitive information from malicious actors by enabling proactive defense strategies.
